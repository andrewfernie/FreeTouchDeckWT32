Before downloading the file system to the board rename the file:
	wificonfig.json.default
	
to
	wificonfig.json
	
	
and edit the ssid and password fields to your wifi network name and password.

You can always set these through the configurator when the wifi is running as an AP, 
but then you will have to repeat that process every time you download the file system again.
